T7_062617_wt.yml: ecoli_transcript + ribosome reaction constant reduced to 1e6 from 1e7 to simulate weaker ribosome binding sites in ecoli transcripts
T7_072717_wt.yml: first simulation with translation weights, manually shortened gene 1.3 because stop codon may be getting ignored because the transcript ends
T7_072717b_rec.yml: same as above, but gene 10 recoded

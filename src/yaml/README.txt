- t7_wt_genome_params_original.yaml: Specifies a wild type T7 genome. Identical to the corresponding genbank entry (NC_001604) except for the following changes: omitted features: E. coli promoter E[6], T7 promoter phiOR, T7 promoter phiOL, E. coli promoter A0 (leftward). Relabled genes: gene 2 -> gp-2", gene 1 -> rnapol-1, gene 3.5 -> lysozyme-3.5, gene 0.7 -> protein_kinase-0.7. All start positions were incremented by 1.
- t7_wt_model_params_original.yaml: Pinetree Model parameters from Jack et al., 2019. 
    - t7_wt_degrade_jack_2019.yaml: Combines the above two control files to completely specify a simulation. Removes gene 0.4, gene 0.5, gene 0.6A, gene 0.6B, possible gene 0.6B, gene 1.5, gene 1.6, gene 4B, gene 4.1, possible gene 5.5-5.7, gene 10B. Also has the line `opt_codon_factor: 1.0`, which controls how codons are weighted. This produces a simulation equivalent to `phage_model_degrade.py` from Jack et al.
